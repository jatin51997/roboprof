5Adversarial Search
Classical application for heuristic search
simple games: exhaustively searchable
complex games: only partial search possible
additional problem: playing against opponent
Here, we look at 2 -player adversarial games
win, lose, or tie6Types of Games
Perfect Information
A game with the perfect information is that in which agents can 
look into the complete board. Agents have all the information about 
the game, and they can see each other moves also. 
Examples: Chess, Checkers, Go, etc.
Imperfect Information
Game state only partially observable, choices by opponent are not 
visible (hidden)
Example: Battleship, Stratego, many card games, etc.7Types of Games (II)
Deterministic games
No games of chance (e.g., rolling dice)
Examples: Chess, Tic -Tac-Toe, Go, etc.
Non-deterministic games
Games with unpredictable (random) events (involving chance or luck)
Example: Backgammon, Monopoly, Poker, etc.8Types of Games (III)
Zero-Sum Game
If the total gains of one player are added up, and the 
total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero
(example: cutting a cake) 
A gain by one player must be matched by a loss by the 
other player
One player tries to maximize a single value, the other 
player tries to minimize it
Examples: Checkers, Chess, etc.
Non-Zero-Sum Game
Win-Win or Lose -Lose type games
Famous example: The Prisoner’s Dilemma

10Example: Game of Nim
Rules
2 players start with a pile of tokens
move: split (any) existing pile into two non-empty
differently -sized piles
game ends when no pile can be unevenly split
player who cannot make his move loses11State Space of Game Nim
start with one pile of tokens
each step has to divide one pile 
of tokens into 2 non -empty piles 
of different size
player without a move left loses

Game between two opponents, MIN and MAX
MAX tries to win, and 
MIN tries to minimize MAX’s score
Existing heuristic search methods do not work
would require a helpful opponent
Need to incorporate “hostile” moves into search strategy13Exhaustive MiniMax Search 
For small games where exhaustive search is feasible
Procedure:
1.build complete game tree
2.label each level according to player’s turn (MAX or MIN)
3.label leaves with a utility function to determine the outcome 
of the game
e.g., (0, 1) or ( -1, 0, 1)
4.propagate this value up:
if parent=MAX, give it max value of children
if parent=MIN, give it min value of children
5.Select best next move for player at root as the move leading 
to the child with the highest value (for MAX) or lowest 
values (for MIN) 14
Exhaustive MiniMax for Nim
Bold lines indicate
forced win for MAX 
source: G. Luger (2005) 0: win for MIN
1: win for MAX15n-ply MiniMax with Heuristic
Exhaustive search for interesting games is rarely 
feasible
Search only to predefined level
called n-ply look -ahead
n is number of levels
No exhaustive search
nodes evaluated with heuristics and not win/loss
indicates best state that can be reached
horizon effect
Games with opponent
simple strategy: try to maximize difference between 
players using a heuristic function e(n)Heuristic Function for 2 -player games
simple strategy: 
try to maximize difference between MAX’s game and MIN’s 
game 
typically called e(n)
e(n) is a heuristic that estimates how favorable a 
node n is for MAX
e(n) > 0 --> n is favorable to MAX 
e(n) < 0 --> n is favorable to MIN 
e(n) = 0 --> n is neutral

Alpha -beta pruning
Stochastic games
Where we are today
29Alpha -Beta Pruning
Optimization over MiniMax, that:
ignores (cuts off, prunes) branches of the tree 
that cannot possibly lead to a better solution
reduces branching factor
allows deeper search with same effort30Alpha -Beta Pruning: Example 1
With MiniMax, we look at all possible nodes at the n-ply depth
With α -β pruning, we ignore branches that could not possibly 
contribute to the final decision
B will be >= 5
So we can ignore B’s right 
branch, because A must be 3
D will be <= 0
But C will be >= 3
So we can ignore D’s right 
branch
E will be <= 2.
So we can ignore E’s right 
branch
Because C will be 3.

Alpha pruning: 
eg.  if MAX node's α= 6, then the search can prune branches from a MIN 
descendant that has a β<= 6.  
if child β<= ancestor α→prune

eg. if a MIN node's β= 6, then the search can prune branches from a MAX 
descendant that has an α>= 6.

Stochastic (Non -Deterministic)
Games
Search tree for games of chance 
white can calculate its own legal moves
but it does not know what black will roll...
Idea: add chance nodes to the search tree
branches indicate possible dice rolls
each branch labeled with the roll and its probability
(e.g., 1/6 for a single dice roll)Search Tree for Backgammon
EXPECTIMINIMAX Algorithm
Calculating E XPECTIMINIMAX
Like MiniMax, but using the weighted sum for Chance nodes:
r is a possible dice roll (or other random event)
P(r) the probability of the event
Result(s, r) is the same state s with dice roll result r
Note: very expensive due to the high branching factor!

AlphaGo Zero learned the Game by itself, without input of human 
games
Became better than all old versions after 40 days of training
In the first three days, AlphaGo Zero played 4.9 million games 
against itself using reinforcement learning
AlphaZero can learn other

3Neural Networks
Radically different approach to reasoning and 
learning
Inspired by biology
the neurons in the human brain
Set of many simple processing units (neurons) 
connected together
Behavior of each neuron is very simple
but a collection of neurons can have sophisticated 
behavior and can be used for complex tasks 
In a neural network, the behavior depends on 
weights on the connection between the neurons
The weights will be learned given training data4Biological Neurons
Human brain = 
100 billion neurons
each neuron may be connected to 
10,000 other neurons
passing signals to each other via 
1,000 trillion synapses 
A neuron is made of:
Dendrites : filaments that 
provide input to the neuron
Axon : sends an output signal
Synapses : connection with other 
neurons –releases 
neurotransmitters to other 
neurons

A neuron receives inputs from its neighbors
If enough inputs are received at the same time:
the neuron is activated
and fires an output to its neighbors
Repeated firings across a synapse increases its 
sensitivity and the future likelihood of its firing
If a particular stimulus repeatedly causes activity in a 
group of neurons, they become strongly associated6Today

47Applications of Neural Networks
Handwritten digit recognition
Training set = set of handwritten digits (0…9)
Task: given a bitmap, determine what digit it represents
Input: 1 feature for each pixel of the bitmap  
Output: 1 output unit for each possible character (only 1 should 
be activated)
After training, network should work for fonts (handwriting) 
never encountered
Related pattern recognition
applications : 
recognize postal codes
recognize signatures

48Applications of Neural Networks
Speech synthesis
Learning to pronounce English words
Difficult task for a rule -based system because English 
pronunciation is highly irregular 
Examples:
letter “c” can be pronounced [k] ( cat) or [s] ( cents )
Woman vs Women
NETtalk:
uses the context and the letters around a letter to learn how to 
pronounce a letter
Input: letter and its surrounding letters
Output: phoneme49
NETtalk Architecture
Network is made of 3 layers of units
input unit corresponds to a 7 character window in the text
each position in the window is represented by 29 input units 
(26 letters + 3 for punctuation and spaces)
26 output units –one for each possible phoneme Ex:  a cat  →c is pronounced K
source: Luger (2005)Listen to the output through iterations: https ://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gakJlr3GecE50Neural Networks
Disadvantage: 
result is not easy to understand by humans (set of 
weights compared to decision tree)… it is a black box
Advantage: 
robust to noise in the input (small changes in input do not 
normally cause a change in output) and graceful 
degradation52Today

3Neural Networks
◼Radically different approach to reasoning and 
learning
◼Inspired by biology
❑the neurons in the human brain
◼Set of many simple processing units (neurons) 
connected together
◼Behavior of each neuron is very simple
❑but a collection of neurons can have sophisticated 
behavior and can be used for complex tasks 
◼In a neural network, the behavior depends on 
weights on the connection between the neurons
◼The weights will be learned given training data4Biological Neurons
◼Human brain = 
❑100 billion neurons
❑each neuron may be connected to 
10,000 other neurons
❑passing signals to each other via 
1,000 trillion synapses 
◼A neuron is made of:
❑Dendrites : filaments that 
provide input to the neuron
❑Axon : sends an output signal
❑Synapses : connection with other 
neurons –releases 
neurotransmitters to other 
neurons

◼A neuron receives inputs from its neighbors
◼If enough inputs are received at the same time:
❑the neuron is activated
❑and fires an output to its neighbors
◼Repeated firings across a synapse increases its 
sensitivity and the future likelihood of its firing
◼If a particular stimulus repeatedly causes activity in a 
group of neurons, they become strongly associated6Today

47Applications of Neural Networks
◼Handwritten digit recognition
❑Training set = set of handwritten digits (0…9)
❑Task: given a bitmap, determine what digit it represents
❑Input: 1 feature for each pixel of the bitmap  
❑Output: 1 output unit for each possible character (only 1 should 
be activated)
❑After training, network should work for fonts (handwriting) 
never encountered
◼Related pattern recognition
applications : 
❑recognize postal codes
❑recognize signatures

48Applications of Neural Networks
◼Speech synthesis
❑Learning to pronounce English words
❑Difficult task for a rule -based system because English 
pronunciation is highly irregular 
❑Examples:
◼letter “c” can be pronounced [k] ( cat) or [s] ( cents )
◼Woman vs Women
❑NETtalk:
◼uses the context and the letters around a letter to learn how to 
pronounce a letter
◼Input: letter and its surrounding letters
◼Output: phoneme49
NETtalk Architecture
◼Network is made of 3 layers of units
◼input unit corresponds to a 7 character window in the text
◼each position in the window is represented by 29 input units 
(26 letters + 3 for punctuation and spaces)
◼26 output units –one for each possible phoneme Ex:  a cat  →c is pronounced K

◼Disadvantage: 
❑result is not easy to understand by humans (set of 
weights compared to decision tree)… it is a black box
◼Advantage: 
❑robust to noise in the input (small changes in input do not 
normally cause a change in output) and graceful 
degradation52Today
